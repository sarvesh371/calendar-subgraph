## General Information
- The subgraph indexes meeting data from the `Calendar` smart contract and stores it in a queryable format.
- It simplifies retrieving meeting details, participant lists, and other data for integration into decentralized applications.
- By enabling quick access to structured meeting data, this subgraph streamlines the development of blockchain-based scheduling and event management tools.

## Indexed Events
- **MeetingCreated**: Captures details of newly created meetings.
- **MeetingRescheduled**: Updates the meeting's date and time upon rescheduling.
- **MeetingCancelled**: Flags the meeting as canceled.
- **ParticipantAdded**: Tracks additional participants added to a meeting.

## Entities
#### Meeting
This entity stores comprehensive details of each meeting:
```graphql
type Meeting @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  meetingId: BigInt! # uint256
  organizer: Bytes! # address
  date: BigInt! # UNIX timestamp
  startTime: BigInt! # Meeting start time in seconds from midnight
  endTime: BigInt! # Meeting end time in seconds from midnight
  agenda: String! # Meeting agenda
  meetLink: String! # Meeting link
  isCancelled: Boolean! # Meeting cancellation status
  participants: [Bytes!]! # Array of participant addresses
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}
```
```graphql
query {
  meetings {
    id
    meetingId
    organizer
    date
    startTime
    startTime
    endTime
    agenda
    meetLink
    participants
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    transactionHash
    isCancelled
  }
}
```

## Technologies and Techniques

### Project configuration
<div style="margin-left: 3rem;" >

```
üì¶root
 ‚î£ üìÇabis  => Calender.json - holds abi of the smart contract.
 ‚î£ üìÇsrc  => calender.ts - translates data from your data sources to the entities defined in the schema.
 ‚î£ üìúschema.graphql  => defines what data you wish to retrieve from the subgraph.
 ‚î£ üìúsubgraph.yaml  => defines what data sources your subgraph will index.
``` 
</div>
